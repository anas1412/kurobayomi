//! The tracker session of the entry screens (T-38b-029, T-39b-038, T-38a-032; E-TRK-5, T-TRK-12, D-10). The trackers live
//! in the settings host, which belongs to the main thread. The entry runners work on other threads, so the host's
//! trackers are published here once and every question reads the tracker's own login state at the moment it is asked.
//! Nothing is cached: a login or a logout shows on the next read.
