//! Storage domain (area 09 section 1, T-09a-047 to T-09a-051): the base directory preference, the folder tree under
//! it, and the change notification. This module is the one place that names the folders inside the storage folder;
//! everything else asks [`StorageManager`] for them.
//!
//! The base directory is a local path. Android content URIs and remote locations are refused with
//! `StorageUnavailable`; the directory picker returns local paths only.
